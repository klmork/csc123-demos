# CSC 123: Demos

This repository contains demos for our CSC 123 computational art course.

CSC 123 focuses on exposing our students to various fields within computer science prior to them taking our fundamentals of computer science course.

This flavor of the course (i.e. computational art) introduces computing through digital art, taking our first look at computer graphics and frontend web development.

We will mostly be focusing on:

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library
  - so we can beginning making interesting projects as soon as possible.

We will also briefly look into:

- HTML & CSS
- git and GitHub
- JS outside the context of p5.js
- VS Code and some useful extensions
